      <h1>Admissions Coding Exercise</h1>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>
        Please write your solution to the coding exercise in <a href="https://repl.it" target="_blank">repl.it</a>.
        repl.it is an online coding environment where you can write code and share the link to your code with other people. It's free to set up an account. Here's how to use it:

        <ol>
          <li>Create an account on <a href="https://repl.it" target="_blank">repl.it</a> by clicking the Sign Up button</li>
          <li>Click the red circle in the bottom right hand corner</li>
          <li>In the search box type Nodejs</li>
          <li>Click on the Nodejs link. You should see a screen like this:
            <br/><img src="repl-it-1.png" />
          </li>
          <li>Add your code to the white box on the left. When you click the <b>run</b> button, the results will show up in the black box on the right</li>
          <li>Once you've completed the coding challenge, click the <b>share</b> button and copy the link in the Share Link box. Send this link to admisions@codeclan.com.</li>
        </ol>

      </p>
      <h2>The Exercise</h2>
       <p>
         Your task is to create a function called getWeather that will have 2 parameters. One called <b>country</b> and one called <b>weatherType</b>. Call the getWeather function with 2 arguments. The first should be "Scotland", the second should be "sunny". Your function should return the String "The weather in Scotland is sunny". Wrap the call to getWeather in a console.log() to print out the String. Call the getWeather function two more times with countries and weatherTypes of your choice.
       </p>
       <h4>HINTS:</h4>
       <ul>
         <li>Start by writing a function using the keyword const and the name getWeather</li>
         <li>Once you've added the parameters and called the function with arguments 3 times, your right hand black screen should look like this:
          <br>
          <img src="repl-it-2.png">
         </li>
       </ul>
