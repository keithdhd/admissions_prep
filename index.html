        <h1>CodeClan Admissions Track</h1>
        <p>Welcome! Thanks for applying to study with CodeClan and well done for making it this far! As part of our admissions process we'd like you to practice some coding and submit a short exercise.
          We're asking you to do this to ensure this is the right course for you. Take your time, enjoy it, we look forward to reading your code.
          Here's how the admissions process works:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Spend time on the <a href="admissions-prep.html" target="_blank">admissions prep learning page</a> going through the recommended lessons (approx 2 to 3 hours).</li>
          <li>Attempt the <a href="coding-challenge.html" target="_blank">coding challenge</a> (30 mins to 1 hour)</li>
          <li>Send your coding exercise link to admissions@codeclan.com</li>
          <li>Book an interview and come along to meet the admisions team, be prepared to talk us through your code. You are welcome to book your interview prior to submitting the coding exercise however, we wont be able to conduct an interview unless you have attempted it and submitted the link by 5pm the day before your interview.</li>
        </ol>
