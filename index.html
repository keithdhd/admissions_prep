        What are we trying to achieve and why?
          <ul>
            <li>Raise the barrier to entry</li>
            <li>Why? To filter out those who are not serious</li>
            <li>Why? To make sure we get suitable people who can do the course and won't drop out of the admissions process and waste time</li>
            <li>As long as there's something in the interview that you can refer to in case your mind goes blank</li>
          </ul>
